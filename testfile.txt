a path that traverses all of the bridges/edges only once. Since then, graph theory has been introduced and 
applied in many different areas over time other than computer science, such as DNA sequencing in biology and the 
“Study of molecules and atoms in chemistry” (What is Graph Theory, and why should you care?, 2020). Later on, around 1956 Edsger 
Dijkstra would come to invent the famous shortest path algorithm for graphs.
The properties of any graph are its vertices and edges, but graphs can be a very versatile data
